# Razorpay Payment Integration Setup

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

The Razorpay payment system has been successfully integrated into your MERN food delivery app.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Razorpay Keys

Edit the file `/workspace/backend/.env` and replace the placeholder values with your actual Razorpay keys:

```env
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_actual_razorpay_key_id_here
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_actual_razorpay_key_secret_here
```

### 2. Start the Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
npm start
# or
nodemon index.js
```

### 3. Frontend is Already Running

The frontend should already be running on `http://localhost:3000`

## 🚀 Features Implemented

- ✅ Order creation endpoint (`/api/payment/create-order`)
- ✅ Payment verification endpoint (`/api/payment/verify-payment`)

- ✅ Environment variables setup
- ✅ Secure signature verification

### Frontend Features:
- ✅ Payment component with Razorpay integration
- ✅ Dynamic script loading for Razorpay checkout
- ✅ Payment success/failure handling

## 🔄 Payment Flow

5. Payment is verified on backend
6. Order is saved to database with payment details
7. Cart is cleared and success message shown

## 🧪 Testing
